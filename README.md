# 2D LiDAR app
2D LiDAR data acquisition and analysis app. The application works with Slamtec A2M8 and Waveshare STL-27L LiDARs. The application was created for the purposes of my thesis entitled "Research on the possibilities of using low-budget LIDAR devices in robotics".

# How to install the app?
To run the application, an environment that supports Python version 3.10 is required. Additionally, the installation of environment extensions such as the following is necessary:
- PyQt5 - 5.15.10
- matplotlib - 3.8.3
- numpy - 1.26.4
- scikit-learn - 1.4.1.post1
- scipy - 1.12.0
- pyserial - 3.3
